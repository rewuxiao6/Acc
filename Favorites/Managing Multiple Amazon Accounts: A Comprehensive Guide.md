## Should You Use a VPN for Managing Multiple Amazon Accounts?

Using a VPN is highly recommended for managing multiple accounts to ensure privacy and reduce suspension risks:

- **IP Address Separation**: A VPN assigns distinct IPs to each account, preventing Amazon from flagging accounts logged in from the same IP.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: VPNs add an extra layer of security, minimizing unusual activity detection.

While VPNs are useful, tools like Multilogin or SellerApp eliminate the need for VPNs by providing robust multi-account management features.
